# react-amplify

Publish React apps to Amplify (demo).

```
# 1. Install Amplify CLI
$ npm install -g @aws-amplify/cli

# 2. Setup Amplify and create a new IAM profile (AdminAccess)
$ amplify configure

# 3a. Launch Amplify from your app
# 3b. Select the appropriate prompts and the Amplify IAM user
$ cd my-app && amplify init
```

At this point, you should see a `amplify` directory in your app root.
